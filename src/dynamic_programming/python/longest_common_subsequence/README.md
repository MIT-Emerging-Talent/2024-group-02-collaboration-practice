Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) implementaion

Author: tvsirius

Different implementations of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm: 

* lcs_basic: This implementation follows a straightforward recursive approach without using memoization or dynamic programming.

* lcs_memo: This implementation likely uses memoization to optimize the recursive approach.

* lcs_tab: This implementation likely uses a tabulation approach, which involves building a table to store results of subproblems iteratively.

All function recieves two stings and output a tuple with (lenght_of_LCS, LCS_string)
