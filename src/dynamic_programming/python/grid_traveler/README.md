## Challenge: Grid_traveler
The grid traversal functions provided are used to calculate the number of ways to travel from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of a grid. There are three different approaches:
grid_traveller_basic: This function implements a basic recursive approach to calculate the number of ways to travel in a grid.

grid_traveller_memo: This function utilizes a memoized recursive approach to calculate the number of ways to travel in a grid.

grid_traveller_table: This function uses a dynamic programming approach with a table to store intermediate results.
